                <p>An open-ended question is a question that cannot be answered with a simple "yes" or "no" response or with a single word or short phrase. It requires the respondent to provide a more detailed or lengthy answer, which allows for more flexibility and complexity in their response. Open-ended questions are often used in research, interviews, and other forms of communication to encourage discussion, exploration of ideas, and the sharing of thoughts and opinions. They are also referred to as open questions or open-ended prompts. An example of an open-ended questions is: "How would you evaluate the qualifications of the candidate?"</p>
