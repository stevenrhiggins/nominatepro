                    <li><strong>5 Points (Exceptional):</strong> The nominee's work has a profound and measurable impact, significantly
                        benefiting a large number of people or the community. Their contributions have long-lasting and
                        widespread effects.</li>
                    <li><strong>4 Points (Very Good):</strong> The nominee's work has a notable impact, with clear benefits that are
                        well-documented. Their contributions have a significant positive effect on the field or
                        community.</li>
                    <li><strong>3 Points (Good):</strong> The nominee's work has a moderate impact, with some benefits but may lack
                        comprehensive evidence. Their contributions are beneficial but not transformative.</li>
                    <li><strong>2 Points (Fair):</strong> The nominee's work has limited impact, with minimal benefits or unclear
                        outcomes. Their contributions have some positive effects but are not substantial.</li>
                    <li><strong>1 Point (Poor):</strong> The nominee's work has little to no impact, with negligible benefits or no
                        evidence of positive outcomes. Their contributions are not impactful.</li>
