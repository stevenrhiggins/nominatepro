                <p>Our judging module helps you evaluate nominations with ease, ensuring fair, consistent, and efficient assessments. Included as part of your existing service at no extra cost, it simplifies scoring, feedback collection, and result tracking for a seamless, transparent judging process. You can choose to apply or skip the judging module for each question individually.

                <p class="has-text-weight-semibold">1. Evaluation Questions</p>
                <p>Create custom questions for judges to assess each nominee or nominator response to each question. You can choose from two types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Open-ended Questions:</strong> These invite detailed responses rather than simple "yes" or "no" answers. For example: "How would you evaluate the candidate’s response to this question?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Numeric Questions:</strong> Judges select a rating on a numeric or Likert scale. These responses help measure attitudes or opinions and allow for statistical comparison across judges.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <p class="has-text-weight-semibold">2. Scoring Question Importance</p>
                <p>Each question can be assigned a value that determines its weight in the final score:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Open-ended Questions:</strong> The assigned value is used directly as the score. For example, if you assign a value of 6, every response scores 6.</li>
                    <li><strong>Numeric Questions:</strong> The judge’s selected rating is multiplied by the assigned value. For example, a rating of 4 with a value of 8 results in a score of 32. This includes Likert scales (e.g., 1 = "Very Poor" to 5 = "Excellent").</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="content">
                <p class="has-text-weight-semibold">3. Scoring Rubric</p>
                <p>A scoring rubric provides judges with clear, predefined criteria for evaluating responses. It ensures consistency, fairness, and transparency by guiding how each submission should be assessed. <a href="#" data-target="rubric" class="js-modal-trigger">Click here to see an example.</a></p>

            <div class="content">
                <p class="has-text-weight-semibold">4. Question Value</p>
                <p>Assign a numeric value to each question. This value determines how much the question contributes to the overall score.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>This setup helps you organize and manage the judging process effectively, ensuring fair scoring based on question type and importance.</p>
